				My name is Ransky Allonce. When I first graduated high school I was unsure as to what I wanted my field of study to be. I bounced between computer science and graphic design before realizing that neither were really for me. At that point I decided toto try web development hoping that it would be a better fit for me. As, it turns out I seemed to want to futher myself in. While I did take classes towards my major at my community college I also seked extra knowledge from online class ervices such as udacity. I am currently studying at drexel university pursuing a degree in interactive digital media.
